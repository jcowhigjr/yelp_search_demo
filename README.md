# DorkBob

DorkBob is a pretty generic Ruby on Rails application that allows users to find anything near them by topic, utilizing the Yelp Fusion API.

Use the application at https://dorkbob.herokuapp.com

## Motivation:

I was looking for a project to practice on when i had spare time and found.

## Attribution
  Sean was kind enough to let me share it with potential employers and so that might be what you are seeing this.

Jitter totally vibed with me because my favorite place to code has been in coffeeshops, and I was like I will enjoy myself at a coffeeshop working on a coffeeshop app.

## Changes/Rebranding:

One day I decided I wanted to help find tacos and directions to a yoga studio so then i switched it up.

Currently, I would say it has promise of a baby yelp with old school good enough features:

 Search for something near you.
 Decide what you want to try

 Reuse the app day to day for favorite spots.

 Click a button and call them for example to order take out.
 Click another button for directions.
 Link out to yelp for more features.

Future Opportunities
  Filter the favorites based on your location.
