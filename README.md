# DorkBob

DorkBob is a pretty generic Ruby on Rails application that allows users to find anything near them by topic, utilizing the Yelp Fusion API.

Use the application at https://dorkbob.herokuapp.com

## Motivation:

I was looking for a project to practice on when i had spare time and found.

## Attribution
  Sean was kind enough to let me share it with potential employers and so that might be what you are seeing this.

  Sean's blog and source code:

Jitter totally vibed with me because my favorite place to code has been in coffeeshops, and I was like I will enjoy myself at a coffeeshop working on a coffeeshop app.

## Changes/Rebranding:

One day, without research 🧐,  I decided I wanted to help find tacos and directions to a yoga studio so then i switched it up.

Currently, I would say it has promise of a baby yelp with old school good enough features:

 Search for something near you.
 Decide what you want to try

 Reuse the app day to day for favorite spots.

 Click a button and call them for example to order take out.
 Click another button for directions.
 Link out to yelp for more features.

Future Opportunities?
  Remove unused features:
    rating?
  Extend used features:
    pictures -- pull in more
    user submitted photos?
    teach me how to make this?
  Yelpish: 
    Filter the favorites based on your location.
    Share with friends?
    Help make a quick decision with a decision wheel.
    Live Poll for the best choice.
  Keep a tally of the places you've been.
  Non-Yelpish:
    specialize and white label by topic build community if there is traction
      for example, make it local by neighborhood
    become a tool for 
    
## For Devs ->
   Most of the work here was actually building out the CI/CD/Security/Update lifecycle of the project.
