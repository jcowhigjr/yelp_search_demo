# DorkBob needs a name

A pretty generic Ruby on Rails 7 application that allows users to find anything near them by topic, utilizing the Yelp Fusion API.

Use the application at https://dorkbob.herokuapp.com

## Motivation:

I was looking for a project to practice on when i had spare time.

## For Devs ->
  Once I ran out of feature ideas, most of the work here was actually building out the CI/CD/Security and now
  Automatic Updates
 
 I have added some notes and resources here:
 [Resources.md](../develop/Resources.md) 
 [DevNotes.md](../develop/DevNotes.md)
 

## Attribution
  Sean was kind enough to let me share it with potential employers.

  Sean's blog and source code:

Jitter totally vibed with me because my favorite place to code has been in coffeeshops, and I was like I will enjoy myself at a coffeeshop working on a coffeeshop app.

## Changes/Rebranding:

One day, without research üßê,  I decided I wanted to help find tacos and directions to a yoga studio so then i switched it up.

Old school good enough features:

 Search for something near you.
 Decide quickly with the 'Decision Wheel'

 Reuse the app day to day for favorite spots.

 Click telephone üìû and call a human to order take out.
 Click üß≠ for directions to open in your phone to get there.

 Not sure about a place ..  link out to yelp for more features.

Future Opportunities?
  Remove unused features:
    seperate user rating? (this is not allowed by the yelp agreement anyway)
  Extend used features:
    pictures -- pull in more with click
    user submitted photos .. hmm ActiveStorage could handle this.
  
  Add a business plan:
  
  Yelpish: 
    Filter the favorites based on your location.

  Social:
    Share with friends? 
    Live Poll for where to go.
  
  Personal: Keep a tally of the places you've been.
  
  Community:
    Specialize and white label by search term .. eg) coffee.dorkbob.com
    Or make it local by neighborhood or club.    eg) taco-club.dorkbob.com
